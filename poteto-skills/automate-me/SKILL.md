# Automate me

A guided flow for turning the user's working conventions into a skill agents will follow. The output is one `-mode` skill tailored to them (e.g. `jay-mode`, `priya-mode`).

This skill orchestrates three others: an inline mining pass (see step 1), the `skill-creator` skill (authoring), and the **unslop** skill (prose discipline). It sequences them. It doesn't replace them.

## Flow

### 0. Check for an existing skill

Look for `.claude/skills/*-mode/SKILL.md` in the project and `~/.claude/skills/*-mode/SKILL.md` for the user, matching the user's handle. `~/.claude/skills` may be a symlink or junction into a git repo; resolve it and look there. If one exists, confirm intent with `AskUserQuestion` (unless they already said "update my skill" or similar):

- Update the existing skill (default for repeat runs)
- Start fresh (rare, ask why before doing it)

Update mode changes the rest of the flow:
- Step 1 mines only history since the skill was last edited (`git log -1 --format=%cI <path>`).
- Step 2 asks what's changed or missing, not what to capture from zero.
- Step 4 edits the existing file in place. Preserve sections the user hasn't contradicted. Revise ones with new evidence. Add new sections only for genuinely new rules.

### 1. Mine their history

Locate transcripts before fanning out. Claude Code writes them to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/*.jsonl`, where `<project>` is the session's starting directory with every character that isn't a letter or digit replaced by `-` (match case-insensitively). User turns are lines with `"type":"user"` whose content is text, not a `tool_result`.

Default to the current project's directory only. Globbing across `~/.claude/projects/*/` reads chats from unrelated projects, so do it only when the user asks for a cross-project mode skill. Ask with `AskUserQuestion` before widening. If they also use VS Code Copilot Chat, offer its history too: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\<hash>\chatSessions\*.json[l]`, where each workspace's `workspace.json` names its folder and user prompts are the `message.text` of each request.

Survey recent agent conversations within that scope for recurring patterns. Run multiple parallel subagents across slices of history (e.g. last 2-4 weeks, split into 3 slices so each has enough material). Each slice mining subagent reads transcripts from the workspace-scoped path the parent provides, looks for the signals below, and returns a short structured list of patterns it saw with evidence pointers. Default signals worth hunting:

- Response preferences (length, tone, format, "dumb it down" corrections)
- Delegation habits (subagents, models, specialized workflows, parallelism)
- Verification posture (what "done" means, unit tests vs live repro, reviewers)
- Code and prose discipline (style, principles cited, lint/format tools)
- Process conventions (worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling)
- Meta preferences (fixing skills mid-task, proposing new ones)

Cross-check across slices before elevating a signal. Patterns seen in 2+ slices are high-confidence. Lone signals are weak and usually get dropped.

### 2. Ask the user directly

Mining misses intent that hasn't come up yet. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool (structured multi-choice) rather than asking the user to type from scratch.

Shape: one call with up to 4 questions of 2-4 options each (the tool's limits; it adds an "Other" option itself), `multiSelect: true` for category questions. Start broad ("Which areas matter most?"), then follow up on selected areas with specific options. After the structured rounds, one free-form chat question catches anything the options missed.

Don't dump 20 questions.

### 3. Cluster findings

Group the combined signals into sections. Common ones (use only what applies):

- **Response style**: length, tone, format.
- **Autonomy**: how much to do without asking, MCP tool use.
- **Understand first**: which skills to reach for when scoping or investigating a change.
- **Subagents**: default, parallelism, model-to-task, specialized workflows.
- **Prose / code discipline**: principles, lint tools, style guides.
- **Review and verify**: repro posture, verification skills, live-testing tools.
- **Process**: git worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling.
- **Skills**: skill-authoring habits, fix-the-skill-first, proposing new skills.

poteto's own mode skill shows the shape: https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/main/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md (fetch with `gh api repos/cursor/plugins/contents/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md --jq .content | base64 -d`). Read it for granularity. Don't copy its content. The user's rules are not the same as poteto's.

### 4. Draft the skill

Use the `skill-creator` skill to author the skill. Placement:

- Path: preserve an existing mode skill's location. For a new mode, default to `~/.claude/skills/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` (a personal skill that applies in every project), or `.claude/skills/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` if the user wants it scoped to one project. Skill folders must sit directly under a `skills/` directory; Claude Code does not discover nested category folders. If the skills directory is a repo with a `CLAUDE.md`, follow its conventions.
- Handle: the user's first name or chosen identifier.
- Frontmatter `description`: trigger on their name + `/<handle>-mode` + "work in their style", not on generic keywords like "write code" or "review PR".
- Frontmatter formatting: follow `skill-creator`'s YAML rules. Keep `description` as one YAML scalar. Quote it or use `description: >-` with indented continuation lines when punctuation or wrapping requires it.
- Frontmatter `disable-model-invocation: true` by default. Opt out only if the user explicitly wants Claude to load the mode on its own. If they want it on every turn, point to it from their user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead.

### 5. Iterate on prose

Apply the **unslop** skill and `skill-creator`'s writing guidelines to every line.

Show the draft to the user and take feedback. Expect multiple iterations. Cut ruthlessly. A mode skill is not a manual.

### 6. Land it

If the skill lives in a git repo, follow that repo's conventions. Absent any, work on a branch off main, commit, and open a PR. Don't push to main directly.

## Guardrails

- **Don't overfit to one conversation.** A preference stated once and contradicted another time is noise. Require multiple instances before codifying it.
- **Don't be clever.** Restating other skills' contents, inventing metaphors, or writing "poetic" prose for an agent reader is cost without benefit. Keep it operational.
- **Reference, don't inline.** Other skills the user relies on should appear as path references, not pasted excerpts. Same for any principle docs they maintain elsewhere.
- **Keep sections minimal.** Only add a section if the user has a specific, non-default rule there. "Communicate clearly" is not a section. "Short paragraphs. Tables when comparing options. Bullets only when items are genuinely parallel." is.
- **Name conventions generic.** Use "the user" or "the human" in imperatives, not the author's first name.
- **Don't force symmetry.** If a user has no process rules worth writing down, skip the Process section entirely.

## Evaluation

A `-mode` skill is subjective output. A `skill-creator`-style test/iterate benchmark loop isn't useful here. Vibe-check with the user: does it read like them? Did it miss anything? Then ship.

Run a description-optimization loop only if the skill's trigger accuracy turns out to be a problem in practice.

## When not to use

- User wants a task-specific skill (not working conventions): `skill-creator` alone, no mining required.
- User wants to capture one narrow workflow (e.g. "how I write commit messages"). That's a regular skill, not a mode skill.
